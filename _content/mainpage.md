About
------------

Gorsync Backup is a GTK+ frontend for brilliant [RSYNC](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.html) console utility.  Written completely in [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), provides responsive GUI design and intuitive interface. Might be used as training material how to write rich multi-threaded GUI application with GTK+ in Golang.

Gorsync Backup is not an all-purpose RSYNC wrapper. It was created to keep in mind how to do regular backup of your personal data from home NAS (either small business file server with RSYNC service enabled) with minimal effort. Gorsync Backup doesn't implement user interface for any possible RSYNC option and case, but use all the best from powerful RSYNC utility to perform regular data backup easily and quickly.

If you not going to pay monthly fee for cloud space to backup your personal data, but instead prefer to buy inexpensive mass-market 2TB-4TB portable external hard drive, than your average backup scheme will looks like: attach USB hard drive to desktop/notebook with Linux OS, start Gorsync Backup application, choose backup profile (once configured), run the backup process and you can go and enjoy your coffee cup.

The application will do the rest: estimate size of data to backup, display extensive progress information and once it done report about completion. If this is not your first backup, then application will significantly speed up backup process, because it keeps previous backup history in destination location and has "deduplication" capabilities, which allow do not copy over the network data that was backed up in previous sessions (withal it saves a lot of space as well): in my experience repeated backup of whole photography archive which exceed 650Gbyte from my home NAS with new pictures from last few months, takes 15 minutes.


Features and benefits
----------------------

* Multiple backup profiles are supported. Moreover, each profile can be configured to get data from multiple RSYNC sources/modules. Password protected RSYNC modules supported.
* 2-pass backup session approach to estimated backup volume in 1st pass. Display predicted time of completion in 2nd pass.
* Demonstrate "deduplication" on modern file systems, once previous backup sessions found (and significant time reduction in repeated backup processes). Works if backup destination is Ext3/Ext4/NTFS (employ file system hardlink feature).
* [Improved GOTK3+](https://github.com/d2r2/gotk3) library (GTK+ golang bindings) used for GUI.

Installation approaches
-----------------------

##### Build and run from sources:

* Verify, that RSYNC console utility is installed.
* Download Gorsync Backup sources (with all dependent golang libraries):
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/d2r2/go-rsync
```
* Compile and deploy application GLIB gsettings schema, with console prompt:
```bash
$ cd ./ui/gtkui/ && sudo ./gs_schema_install.sh && cd ../..
```
* Finally, run app from terminal:
```bash
$ ./gorsync_run.sh
```

##### Precompiled linux packages (deb, rpm and others) from releases:

Alternative approach to install application is to downloads installation packages from latest release, which can be found in [release page](https://github.com/d2r2/go-rsync/releases). You may find there packages for deb (Debian, Ubuntu), rpm (Fedora, Centos, Redhat) and pkg.tar.xz (Arch linux) Linux distributives.


##### Archlinux AUR repository:

One can be found in AUR repository https://aur.archlinux.org/ by name "gorsync-git" to download, compile and install latest release. On Archlinux you can use any AUR helper to install application, for instance `yaourt -S gorsync-git`.

Gorsync Backup backup process explanation
-----------------------------------------

* As in regular [RSYNC](https://ss64.com/bash/rsync_options.html) session, Gorsync Backup is doing same job: copy files from one location (source) to another (backup destination). For instance, real life scenario would be: backing up your data from home NAS to flash hard drive attached to your notebook.

* Gorsync Backup can copy from multiple RSYNC sources at once. It could be your pictures, movies, document's from home NAS, routers and smart Linux device configuration files (/etc/... folder) and so on... Thus Gorsync Backup profile let you specify multiple separated RSYNC URL sources to get data from in single backup session and combine them all together in one destination place.

* Gorsync Backup never overwrite previous backup session data, but use same common target root path, to put data near in new folder. For instance, your flash drive backup folder content might looks like:
```
$ <destination root folder to stores backup content>
$             ↳ ~rsync_backup_20180801-012237~
$             ↳ ~rsync_backup_20180802-013113~
$             ↳ ~rsync_backup_<date>-<time>~
...
$             ↳ ~rsync_backup_20180806-014036~
$             ↳ ~rsync_backup_(incomplete)_20180807-014024~
```
, where each specific backup session stored in separate folder with date and time in the name. "(incomplete)" phrase stands for backup, that occurs at the moment. Once backup will be completed, "(incomplete)" will be removed from backup folder name. Another scenario is possible, when backup process has been interrupted for some reason: in this case "(incomplete)" phrase will never get out from folder name. But, in any case it's easy to understand where you have consistent backup results, and where not.

* In its turn, each backup folder has next regular structure:
```
$ <root folder to store backup contents on flash drive>
$             ↳ ~rsync_backup_20180801-012237~
$                       ↳ ~backup_log~.log
$                       ↳ ~backup_nodes~.signatures
$                       ↳ <folder with rsync source #1 content>
...
$                       ↳ <folder with rsync source #N content>
```
, where `~backup_log~.log` file describe all the details about the steps occurred, including info/warning/error messages if any took place. `~backup_nodes~.signatures` file contains hash imprint for all source URLs, to detect in future backup sessions same data source for "deduplication" purpose.

* Gorsync Backup is splitting backup process to the peaces. Application in every backup session is trying to find optimal data block size to backup at once. To reach this application download folders structure in 1st pass to analyze how to divide the whole process into parts. Ordinary single data block size selected to be not less than 300 MB and no more than 5 GB.



"Deduplication" capabilities
----------------------------
Once you start using Gorsync Backup on regular basis (monthly/weekly/daily), you will find soon that your backup storage will be filled with sets of almost same files (of course changes over time will provides some relatively small deviation between data sets). This redundancy might quickly exhaust your free space, but there is a real magic exists in modern file systems - "hard links"! Hard links allow do not spent space for the files, which have been found in previous backup sessions unchanged. Additionally it's significantly speed up backup process. The collaboration of Gorsync Backup with RSYNC know how to activate this feature. Still you have possibility to opt out this feature in application preferences, but in general scenario you don't need to do this.

Remember, that such legacy file systems as FAT, does not support "hard links", but successors, such as NTFS, Ext3, Ext4 and others have "hard links" supported (via file system "inode" feature). So, think in advance which file system to choose for your backup destination.

>*Note*: Gorsync Backup and RSYNC has some limitations with "deduplication" - they can't track file renames and relocations inside backup directory tree to save space and time in next backup session. This is not the application problem, it's RSYNC utility limitation. There is some experimental patches exist to get rid of this limitation, but not in the public RSYNC releases: you can read [this](https://lincolnloop.com/blog/detecting-file-moves-renames-rsync/) and [this](http://javier.io/blog/en/2014/08/06/rsync-rename-move.html).
